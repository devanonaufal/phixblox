# PhixBlox

A lightweight, performance-optimized utility and hub script for Roblox. PhixBlox focuses on providing essential features like ESP, Aimbot, and Player modifications with a clean, unobtrusive user interface. The script separates visual rendering from physics loops to eliminate game stuttering.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This script is designed for educational/testing purposes. Modifying the game client violates Roblox's Terms of Service and may result in account moderation or bans. Use at your own risk.
